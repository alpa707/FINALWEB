# FINALWEB
After you have downloaded the file, you need to open it using any browser on your computer. 
On our site, all the pages are listed and you can register through the Java script, but unfortunately no login page has been created. 
Each page of our site is located in a separate file and you can understand how to access each page. 
The main page of our site contains all the objects in parts, for example, there is a registration page that was created using a java script and is currently working.
There is also a search page for paintings, as the theme of our site "Gallery", for this search is not finalized until the end. The rest of the pages are created according to all the criteria of our project and everything works.
