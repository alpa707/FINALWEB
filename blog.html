										<p>Modern industrial automation is developing its market at a rapid pace. This is directly related to the development of the fourth industrial revolution - Industry 4.0. It is the amalgamation of industry and digital technology, resulting in smart factories or factories and digital manufacturing. The main challenge for Industry 4.0 is not to change what it makes, but how it is produced. <br> <br>

                                            The leading change, of course, is the movement towards a decrease in the number of elements involved in the control system and tracking of technological processes. For example, the creation of a SCADA system, which allows combining the functions of a PLC and an operator visualization panel, which directly simplified and reduced the cost of the control cabinet for technological processes. <br> <br>
                                            
                                            At this stage, key changes in familiar technologies are being made by merging two areas: industrial production and digital technologies. Soon, the condition for the functioning of any production will be the direct information interaction of various installations and devices. This kind of technology is called machine-to-machine interaction (M2M) and closely overlaps with the industrial "Internet of Things" (IIoT). The concept of this innovation is the exchange of data between all departments of the enterprise (enterprise specialists, executive components, ERP systems, robots, products and other installations) that are involved in the production chain. <br> <br> 
                                            
                                            Since Industry 4.0 allows the massive introduction of cyber-physical systems into production, global process automation and endowing devices with artificial intelligence, this has a direct impact on reducing the cost of the product and increasing productivity. In addition, already at this stage, many manufacturers are introducing personalized production, for example: Nike provides the opportunity to order sneakers with your pattern. <br> <br>
                                            
                                             Based on all these possibilities, there are four main principles that are changing Industry 4.0: <br> 
                                            1. Compatibility - all devices and machines must be able to communicate with each other in one language, through the "Internet of things", have direct compatibility; <br>
                                            2. Transparency - creating a digital copy of a product, collecting data from microchips and sensors through which devices communicate; <br>
                                            3. Technical support - the software collects, analyzes, organizes, visualizes data received from sensors, and helps a person make decisions or makes them automatically, thereby freeing up human resources; <br>
                                            4. Decentralization of management decisions - automation of various decisions by systems, maximum complete substitution of people. <br> <br>
                                            
                                            The food industry is one of the areas for which the introduction of new technologies is vital, as it provides a number of advantages: <br>
                                            - Increase in productivity; <br>
                                            - Improving the efficiency of the production process; <br>
                                            - Reducing operating costs; <br>
                                            - Ensuring a high level of security; <br>
                                            - Minimization of the human factor; <br>
                                            - Improving product quality;  <br>
                                            - Reducing the likelihood of manufacturing defects. <br> <br>
                                            
                                            An example of the introduction of new technology into a production line is the Eaton SmartWire-DT communication system, which is used in an automated processing line for poultry cutting. This system unites in a single network various automation components and low-voltage actuators located in the control cabinet and outside it. The switching system distributes power and control signals over a single loop. The connection between SmartWire-DT and the PLC is provided by a router. SmartWire-DT is used to save space in production, reduce product costs and increase equipment functionality. <br> <br>
                                            
                                            But there is also a negative side to the development of the fourth revolution. Automation of processes leads to the release of jobs; it is necessary to retrain specialists for other types of activities. The importance of low- and medium-skilled labor will decline, which will lead to a decrease in income and material wealth of the middle class. Low purchasing power of the population will lead to low demand, which will reduce the profitability of enterprises. Since this stage of industrial development is mainly the digitalization of production, there is a danger of hacker attacks. <br> <br>
                                            
                                            However, at this point in time, the merger of technologies allows: to change the root processes of production, consumption and cultivation; optimize machinery, reducing and eliminating the risks of failure affecting the production line. Also, with the help of modernization of production technology, it is possible to ensure the leadership of the enterprise in the Russian market. Today, there are enough specialists and companies in Russia for the Industry 4.0 concept to be implemented at existing enterprises. Technologies such as SmartWire-DT will optimize your workflow for all industry specifics.</p>

										<p>Global economic evolution, driven by industrialization, has led to the creation of demand-oriented consumption centers as well as industrial sectoral clusters. While technological inventions have spurred the development of the industrial sector, global economic expansion has led to the emergence of a myriad of industrial products and goods designed to meet basic and non-basic needs and requirements. The continuous development of technology over the past two centuries has greatly influenced our lives and changed the paradigm of the industry. </p>
